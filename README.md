# UNP_CLASSIFICATION_PROJECT_WITH_PYTHON_CUSTOMER_CHURN_ANALYSIS


The **Customer Churn Analysis** project predicts which customers are likely to leave using machine learning. The dataset from the *UCI Iranian Churn Dataset* includes **3,150 rows and 14 columns** with customer demographics and service details. After handling outliers using the **Z-score method** and encoding categorical variables, exploratory analysis revealed key churn factors like **complaints, subscription length, and usage behavior**. Three models—**Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest**—were tested, with **Random Forest achieving the highest accuracy of 95%** using a 70-30 train-test split. The model helps businesses identify at-risk customers early, improving **retention and reducing revenue loss**.
